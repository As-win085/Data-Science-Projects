A machine learning model using 'Support Vector Machine (SVM)' to classify water as potable or non-potable based on its physicochemical properties (e.g., pH, hardness, solids, sulfate, chloramines). The project involved comprehensive data cleaning, missing value imputation, and normalization to ensure robust model performance. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in water quality and engineered relevant features to enhance predictive accuracy.

**Key Highlights:**

* Implemented and tuned an SVM classifier, achieving strong performance in classifying water potability.
* Applied techniques such as feature scaling (StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler) and data visualization for deeper insights.
* Evaluated model using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
* Gained practical experience in building classifiers for real-world environmental safety data.
