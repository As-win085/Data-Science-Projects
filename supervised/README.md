# supervised Machine Learning Projects
This folder contains a collection of supervised machine learning projects that apply various classification and regression algorithms to real-world datasets. Each project includes:

Problem statement and dataset overview

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model selection (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, etc.)

Model evaluation using appropriate metrics (accuracy, RMSE, precision, recall, etc.)

Visualizations and key insights

These projects demonstrate practical applications of supervised learning techniques in domains like healthcare, finance, marketing, and more.
