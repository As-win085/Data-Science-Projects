# ðŸ”¢ðŸ§  DigiNet: Handwritten Digit Recognition
DigiNet is a deep learning project that focuses on recognizing handwritten digits (0â€“9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a benchmark in image classification, and achieves high accuracy in classifying grayscale digit images.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
Objective: Build a robust CNN model to classify handwritten digit images into their correct numeric labels.

Dataset: MNIST â€“ 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.

Frameworks: TensorFlow / Keras 

ðŸ§  Key Features:
Image preprocessing and normalization

Custom CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers

Use of dropout for regularization

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and test predictions

Visualization of training performance and predictions

âœ… Results:

Demonstrates strong generalization and robustness for real-world digit recognition tasks

This project highlights the practical power of deep learning in computer vision and serves as a foundational model for more advanced OCR and digit recognition applications.
