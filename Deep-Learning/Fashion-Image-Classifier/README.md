# ðŸ‘—ðŸ§  Fashion Image Classifier (Deep Learning Project)
This project involves building a deep learning model to classify images of fashion items into categories such as shirts, shoes, dresses, and more. Using the popular Fashion MNIST dataset, the model is trained to automatically recognize clothing types based on grayscale image inputs.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
Objective: Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately classify fashion item images into 10 predefined categories.

Dataset: Fashion MNIST â€” 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items with labels.

Framework: TensorFlow / Keras 

ðŸ§  Key Features:
Data preprocessing and normalization

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture

Use of dropout and batch normalization for regularization

Model training and evaluation with accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix

Visualization of predictions and class-wise performance

âœ… Results:
Achieved high accuracy on the test set, with strong generalization to unseen fashion item images.
